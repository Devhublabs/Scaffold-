# Scaffold

A real-time collaborative drawing platform for manga, comic, and digital artists.

Scaffold is a web application that allows multiple artists to draw on the same canvas simultaneously while communicating through voice chat. Rather than generating artwork with AI, Scaffold focuses on speeding up the creative process by providing collaborative tools, geometry-based shape cleanup, and artist-friendly workflows that preserve each user's unique style.

Built by DevHub Labs.

## Features

### Drawing
- Mouse, touch and stylus support
- Pressure-sensitive drawing (where supported)
- Multiple brushes
- Eraser
- Layers
- Undo / Redo
- Select & Scale
- Manga page templates

### Collaboration
- Shared drawing rooms
- Live cursor tracking
- Real-time stroke synchronization
- Voice communication
- Auto-save

### Snap-to-Shape
Automatically cleans rough:
- Circles
- Ellipses
- Lines
- Rectangles

using geometry fitting instead of AI.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React
- Fabric.js
- Pointer Events API
- Socket.IO Client

**Backend**
- Python
- FastAPI
- python-socketio
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JWT Authentication

**Database**
- MongoDB

**Voice**
- WebRTC (Daily.co / Agora)

## Getting Started

The entire stack runs locally with Docker, so you don't need Node, Python, or MongoDB installed on your machine — only [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### Run the whole project

From the repository root:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This builds and starts every service. The first build takes a few minutes; later runs are cached and much faster. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop, or start in the background with `docker-compose up --build -d` (then `docker-compose down` to stop).

### Services & ports

| Service          | URL                         | Port    | Stack                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| frontend         | http://localhost:5173       | `5173`  | React 19 + Vite                |
| backend-python   | http://localhost:8000       | `8000`  | FastAPI + Socket.IO            |
| backend-node     | http://localhost:4000       | `4000`  | Express (auth, JWT, export)    |
| mongo            | mongodb://localhost:27017   | `27017` | MongoDB 7                      |

Quick sanity check that the backends are up: open <http://localhost:8000> (FastAPI) and <http://localhost:4000/health> (Express).

### Environment variables

**No `.env` file is required to boot** — development defaults are baked into `docker-compose.yml`. To override them (for example, to set a real `JWT_SECRET`), copy the example file at the repo root and edit it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable      | Used by        | Default                        |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `JWT_SECRET`  | backend-node   | `dev-secret-change-me`         |
| `MONGO_URI`   | backend-node   | `mongodb://mongo:27017/ucdp`   |

`.env` is git-ignored, so local secrets are never committed.

### Notes for development

- Each service's source folder is mounted into its container, so saving a file hot-reloads that service (Vite HMR for the frontend, `nodemon` for backend-node, `uvicorn --reload` for backend-python).
- `backend-node` currently ships a **minimal Express server** exposing only `/health`. Build authentication, JWT, and the export service on top of `backend-node/server.js`.

## Creating Files

This repository intentionally contains folders only for most feature areas.

Each contributor is responsible for creating their own files inside the appropriate folders.

For example:
- Pages go inside `frontend/src/pages`
- Shared UI goes inside `frontend/src/components`
- Canvas logic goes inside `frontend/src/canvas`
- Socket code goes inside `frontend/src/socket`
- Styles go inside `frontend/src/styles`

Do not create files outside your assigned area without discussing it with the team.

## Development Workflow

1. Pull the latest changes.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Build your assigned feature.
4. Commit with clear commit messages.
5. Push your branch.
6. Open a Pull Request.
7. After review, merge into main.

## Documentation

The complete Product Requirements Document (PRD), design system, architecture, and API contracts are available inside the `docs` folder.

### Frontend Progress Update - July 13, 2026

Obi's frontend canvas work now includes:

- Pressure-sensitive pencil and pen brushes using Fabric.js Pointer Events.
- Eraser brush that draws with the current canvas background color.
- Brush switching between pencil, pen, and eraser.
- Logical layer tracking through `LayersContext`.
- Verified `Sketch` layer object tracking: drawing a stroke adds the Fabric object to the active layer.
- Basic global undo / redo stack for v1.
- Singleton Socket.IO client in `frontend/src/socket/socket.js`.
- Canvas emits `join_room_event` to the Python backend when the canvas loads.
- Canvas emits throttled `cursor` events during pointer movement.
- Canvas emits `stroke` events after Fabric fires `path:created`.
- Canvas listens for `user_joined`, `cursor`, `stroke`, and `canvas_state`.
- Incoming remote cursors render as labeled cursor dots.
- Incoming remote strokes replay onto the Fabric canvas.

Current frontend development placeholders:

- `roomId` is hardcoded as `abc123`.
- `userId` is generated in `sessionStorage` as `user_xxxxx`.
- `authToken` is currently `dev-token`.
- These should be replaced once the room/auth flow is ready.

Frontend stroke payload:

```js
{
  type: "stroke",
  roomId,
  userId,
  points: [[x, y], ...],
  pressures: [0.4, 0.6, ...],
  color,
  width
}
```

Backend integration note for Ronald:

- The frontend now sends `pressures` alongside `points`.
- Ronald should confirm the Python backend stores and broadcasts `pressures` on `stroke` and `canvas_state`.
- If `pressures` are missing from a remote stroke, the frontend falls back to `0.5` pressure so replay still works.

Verification completed:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Browser smoke test: drawing still creates pixels on the canvas with no runtime errors.
